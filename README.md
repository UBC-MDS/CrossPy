The `CrossPy` package (short for _Cross_-validation in *Py*thon) is a package for performing cross-validation in Python.

### Summary

Cross-validation is an important technique used in model selection and hyper-parameter optimization. Scores from cross-validation are a good estimation of test score of a predictive model in test data or new data as long as the IID assumption approximately holds in data. This package aims to provide a standardized pipeline for performing cross-validation for different modeling functions in Python. In addition, summary statistics of the cross-validation results are provided for users.  

### Functions

Three main functions in `CrossPy`:

- `train_test_split()`: This function split data according to input train/all ratio returns the split data. A random shuffling option is provided.

- `cross_validation()`: This function performs `k`-fold cross validation using the partitioned data and a selected model. It returns the scores of each validation. Additional methods for cross validation will be implemented (such as "Leave-One-Out" if time allows).  

- `summary_cv()`: This function outputs summary statistics(mean, standard deviation, mode, median) of cross-validation scores.

### Examples

To install the package:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/UBCMDS/CrossPy.git
```

Given `X` (features) and `y` (targets) as pandas dataframes, one can split the data with default test size `0.25` as the following:
```
from CrossPy import *
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
```

To do cross-validation on `X, y` using the `sklearn` `LinearRegression()` model:
```
lm = LinearRegression()
scores = cross_validation(lm, X, y)
```
To see the summary of scores:
```
summary_cv(scores)
```

For more options of these functions, please see the documentation and source codes.
